As a user of Zapdos, you have access to some support from developers and other users via the community discussions forum on GitHub:

[https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/discussions](https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/discussions)


If you are struggling with an issue, search to see if someone else has run into the same problem. If they haven't, start a new discussion! You're also welcome to start a discussion about how to contribute any functionality you have developed so others can use it, to share new ideas, or even show off new results! 

Finally, if you encounter a replicable bug in Zapdos code or would like to request a new feature be developed, you can visit our issues page:

[https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/issues](https://github.com/shannon-lab/zapdos/issues)

We do not have time to develop all requested features, but we are happy to help others get started in developing and contributing the features they need for their work. Reach out! :)
