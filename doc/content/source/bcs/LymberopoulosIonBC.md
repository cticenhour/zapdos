# LymberopoulosIonBC

!syntax description /BCs/LymberopoulosIonBC

## Overview

`LymberopoulosIonBC` is a thermal outflow boundary condition with the addition of ion induced secondary electron energy.

The outflow is defined as

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{+} \cdot \textbf{n} = \mu_{+} n_{+} 
\left( 
\text{-} \nabla (V)
\right) 
 \cdot \textbf{n}
\end{equation}

Where $\Gamma_{+} \cdot \textbf{n}$ is the flux of ions normal to the boundary, $\textbf{n}$ is the normal vector of the boundary, $n_{+}$ is the ion density, $\mu_{+}$ is the ion mobility coefficient, and $V$ is the electric potential. When converting the density to log form and applying a scaling factor of the mesh, the strong form for `LymberopoulosIonBC` is defined as

\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{e} \cdot \textbf{n} = \mu_{+} \exp(N_{+}) 
\left( 
\text{-} \nabla (V / l_{c}) 
\right) 
\cdot \textbf{n}
\end{equation}

Where $N_{j}$ is the molar density of the species in log form and
$l_{c}$ is the scaling factor of the mesh.
