# Contribution Guidelines

Zapdos is a collaborative software project, and we welcome all contributions! Because we have
multiple developers and customers working on and using the code, we have various standards,
procedures, and testing processes to maintain the quality of Zapdos code. Our contribution guidlines
page outlines various things to keep in mind when developing Zapdos and submitting code. This page
can be found at https://shannon-lab.github.io/zapdos/development/contributing.html.
